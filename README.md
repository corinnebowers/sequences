This repository provides data, code, and supplementary information associated with the papers "Atmospheric River Sequences as Indicators of Hydrologic Hazard in Present and Future Climates" (doi:XX) and "Temporal Compounding Increases Socioeconomic Impacts of Atmospheric Rivers in California" (doi:XX).
The `_data` folder contains code to collect all of the hydroclimatic data used to generate the first paper's conclusions.
The `_scripts` folder contains code to manipulate the data into timeseries datasets for all grid cells within California. 
The `results` folder contains code and formatted markdown files that reproduce all figures and numerical results from the papers.
The markdown files are also available as interactive HTML documents through the links below.

* [reproduce_figures_sequences.html](https://corinnebowers.github.io/reproduce_figures.html) replicates all figures and numerical results from the main body of the first paper, "Atmospheric River Sequences as Indicators of Hydrologic Hazard in Present and Future Climates".
* [supplementary_figures.html](https://corinnebowers.github.io/supplementary_figures.html) presents the parameter sensitivity analysis and replicates all figures from the Supplemental Information of the first paper.
* [reproduce_figures_impacts.html](https://corinnebowers.github.io/reproduce_figures_impacts.html) replicates all figures and numerical results from the main body of the second paper, "Temporal Compounding Increases Socioeconomic Impacts of Atmospheric Rivers in California".
