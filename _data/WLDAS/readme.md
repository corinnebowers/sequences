This folder contains code to download soil moisture data from the
Western Land Data Assimilation System, developed at the Goddard Space
Flight Center (GSFC) of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency
(NASA). More information about WLDAS is available at
<https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/WLDAS/wldas_domain/>.

The file `get_sm.R` downloads data from the Goddard Earth Sciences Data
and Information Services Center (GES DISC) at
<https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/>. The file `get_sm.Rmd` combines the
individual daily files and processes them for use in the study area.
