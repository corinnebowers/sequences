# GFDL SPEAR Data

This folder contains code to download and process the five-member
Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (SPEAR)
ensemble, from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The `raw` folder
downloads the raw datasets, which are split across Google Drive and
Zenodo. The `biascorr` folder includes code that bias-corrects the IVT
and precipitation against MERRA-2.
