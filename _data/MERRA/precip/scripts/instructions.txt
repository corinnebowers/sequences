1. go to https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and download the data links list (expires within 2 days of generation) 
    * make sure you get MERRA-2, not MERRA
    * bounding box = c(-140,20,-100,60)
    * save this file as url.txt
2. check that the url works
    * url=$(cat url.txt | head -n3 | tail -n1)
    * echo $url
3. check that wget.sh works
    * bash wget.sh $url
4. check that script.exp works
    * ./script.exp $url
    * if it doesn't: autoexpect bash wget.sh $url
    * make sure you keep a copy of script.exp before it gets overwritten!
    * copy back in the following, with edits:

set timeout -1
set url [lindex $argv 0]
spawn bash wget.sh $url
match_max 100000
expect -exact "Password for user ‘cbowers@stanford.edu’: "
send -- "DbSur7p8bfweTaF\r"
expect eof

5. sh wget_loop.sh should work now

6. create zipfile: zip merra_precip.zip MERRA2_*
